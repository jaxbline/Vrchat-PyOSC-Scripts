Just some random scripts I made for Vrchat using PyOSC

# Boop Counter Instructions
Firstly Install latest version of Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

1: Open up Command Prompt and run "pip install python-osc asyncio"

2: You'll need to add a Contact Receiver on your avatar and give it the parameter "BoopCount" and make sure it's set to constant.

3: Once your avatar has the receiver you can run the script and when a player triggers the contact it will count +1

Do note the amount counted takes a moment to update and be displayed

Also you can set up the contact how you like, for me I made it so only other players can interact with it and it only looks for the index finger.

If you have issue using "pip install" Please watch this video on fixing it https://youtu.be/PzlQPNNt8T4
